Strings tend to be placed between double quotes “” though sometimes single quotes ‘’ can be used. Convention is to use double quotes so that you can use single quotes within a string as needed.

Or, for a non-negative range it can represent from 0 to 4,294,967,295. That said, Python 3 dynamically allocates memory and can assign from 8 bits to 64 bits as needed.
