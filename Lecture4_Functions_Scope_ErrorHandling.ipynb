In a few cases, we’ve reused bits and pieces (such as the traversal for our dictionaries), but this is not a good long-term solution. Having repeated blocks of code not only violates the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle of modern programming, it is also harder to maintain. Imagine having to fix one word in a code block and then having to hunt down repeated blocks and fix the same word across a large program. A better way of using blocks of code in various parts of your program is to write functions. \n",

Right now, our function does not allow a number to be entered as a string. There are several ways we can handle this but we need to be careful as we do it. We could, for example, cast all inputs as type int and handle any exceptions that come that way. While we could undoubtedly handle the exceptions, we would unfortunately preclude our function from handling floats, which seems to be a huge problem for temperature data. How might we tackle this problem?\n",

For example, 17 is very different from 17.98 (we lose almost an entire degree!). To make the change, we need to add a second layer of testing to our initial layer. Specifically, once we’ve determined that the input is a str or bool, we check to see whether or not the str can be cast as a float. If it can, we have more usable data. If it can’t, we ignore it and pass to the next statement.\n",

If the interpreter detects the expected error (a Value Error), the “except” comes into play and instructs the program what to do (here it tells it to pass and move to the end of the program).

To calculate the factorial of a number, we multiply each number by the number that came before it. For example:\n",

We can rewrite 6! as ```6*5!``` (thanks to the distributivity of multiplication). This in turn can be written as ```6*5*4!```, and so on. If we knew, for example, that 4! = 24 we could solve this by multiplying ```6*5``` (or 30) with 24 to get 720 (or we could multiply ```6*(5*24)``` and get the same outcome). Knowing this is helpful because it allows us to break down the problem into manageable pieces. \n",

The next level is ```4*6```, which equals 24 and the calls are done–our answer is 24. \n",

Once that base case is met, the answers are returned from the stack and the memory allocated to that call is freed. This is why a base case is vital. Without a case or condition that tells the function to stop, an increasing number of items are placed on the call stack. Eventually, the computer’s memory is reached and the system generates a stack overflow error.\n",
